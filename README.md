# Stadium Satellite Imagery Dataset

## Description
This dataset consists of high-resolution satellite imagery of various stadiums around the world. The images were captured using google earth. The purpose of this dataset is to enable object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, which is a state-of-the-art deep learning technique for real-time object detection. The annotations are provided in the YOLO format and include bounding boxes around various objects of interest such as people, vehicles, and structures.
The dataset can be used for various applications such as security monitoring, crowd management, and event planning. It can also be used to train deep learning models for object detection in satellite imagery. The dataset is suitable for both academic and commercial use.
